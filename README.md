Much of life is simple as a duck, an omnivorous diet keeping you healthy.
Suddenly you see the great bipedal beings provided free food, bread! Oh amazing
Great Maker you have blessed us with such wealth, or is it... Suddenly your
find members of your raft feeling ill, some dying! These great beings are not angels
from the Great Maker, but demons here to bloat and destroy your raft. Someone
must step up to stop this attack against your kind. You lash out with your
wing at the nearest demon, astonished they turn and chase you. After a
few more blows to the demon falls. These demons are mortal, they can
be defeated. Time to take up wings and defeat the rest of them.

As a life long gamer and more recently programmer, I'm enjoying this opportunity to combine my professional skills with my leisurely ones. Looking forward to our progress on this game and continuing to work with a team for the first time in my college career. So far it's been fun!

I've always wanted to try my hand at video game design! While the project our group has undertaken certainly is ambitious, I appreciate the challenges it's pushed us through, and I feel like I've grown a lot as both a coder and a game designer.
